## Course Description
Mastery of the principles and methods in epidemiology and biostatistics is fundamental for the investigation of and response to challenging modern public health issues globally. We aim to expose undergraduates from any discipline to the foundational concepts of biostatistics and epidemiology. Our goal is to broaden the perspectives of incoming freshmen and current undergraduates by exploring various public health tools and techniques. This DeCal will prepare students to undertake independent research projects, participate in formal research inquiries at UC Berkeley, and become scientifically literate public health information consumers. 

## Prerequisites
As an expository course, there are no prerequisites.   

## Learning Outcomes
* Describe the role of epidemiology and biostatistics in addressing public health problems
* Describe the role of data analysis in the biostatistics, epidemiology, data science, and related fields
* Describe common epidemiological study designs
* Calculate measures of disease and association
* Calculate and interpret distributions, confidence intervals, p-values
* State hypotheses and assumptions for statistical tests
* Utilize Python for statistical computing and data cleaning
* Understand the role of regression and predictive modeling in applications to health
* Understand the role of technology, big data and AI in health

## Methods of Instruction
* Facilitators and students will meet weekly on Mondays 6-8pm to learn theoretical concepts.
The first hour will be lecture and the second hour will be reserved for in-class collaboration on
assignments. Students are encouraged to discuss worksheets and projects but should submit
individual copies of their own work

## Attendance
* Attendance is mandatory and students are expected to attend weekly classes. There are 2 unexcused absences allowed throughout the semester. In case of extenuating circumstances, we will accomodate student's needs in order to succeed in the course. Please contact the course email to discuss accomodations and attendance related issues.
