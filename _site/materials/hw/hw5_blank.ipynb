    "In this section, we'll explore and review the basics of machine learning and modeling, an essential tool in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, we use modeling to measure the effect of spread of certain diseases, how different groups react to different levels of treatments, and exploring the confoudig nature of our epidemiological studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll stick to the basics and a general overview on modeling, equipping you with the necessary skills for the final project. Before we get into the questions, let's (re)introduce some of the more commonly used models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A General Overview of Some Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression**: \n",
    "- Models a continous response variable (e.g. price)\n",
    "- Assumes that the interaction between variables is *linear* (e.g. If I increase the value of one variable, how much will my response increase by?)\n",
    "- Creates a best fit line that minimizes the *Root Mean Square Error* ($\\text{RMSE}$) between the line and the data points\n",
    "    - In its simplest form, the line of best fit is in the form: \n",
    "    $$\\underbrace{Y}_{\\text{Response Variable}} = \n",
    "    \\underbrace{\\beta_0}_{\\text{Intercept}}\\hspace{1cm} + \n",
    "    \\hspace{0cm}\n",
    "    \\underbrace{\\beta_1 X}_{\\text{Data times Some Coefficient}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression**: \n",
    "- Models a binary output variable (e.g. disease or no disease)\n",
    "- One of the more common models used in biostatistics and epidemiology \n",
    "    - Used to estimate effect of treatment for control group and treatment group\n",
    "- Returns the *probability* of the response variable based on features of the data\n",
    "- Takes the form:\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{P(Y=1)}_{\\text{Probability of Y = 1}} = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X}}$$\n",
    "    - Where $\\beta_0$ is our intercept, and $\\beta_1 X$ is the coefficient determined by the model times our data\n",
    "    \n",
    "Don't worry too much about the specifics of each model for now. Later on in the semester, we'll work with more complex models that are more specific to the domain of epidemiology and biostatistics. Let's focus more on the overview of constructing models with a Python package. This package is called ```scikit-learn```, also known as ```sklearn```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following questions, we'll be asking about how we prepare our data for model creation using ```sklearn```."
