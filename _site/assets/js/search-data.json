We aim to expose undergraduates from any discipline to the foundational concepts of biostatistics and epidemiology. Our goal is to broaden the perspectives of incoming freshmen and current undergraduates by exploring various public health tools and techniques. This DeCal will prepare students to undertake independent research projects, participate in formal research inquiries at UC Berkeley, and become scientifically literate public health information consumers.
